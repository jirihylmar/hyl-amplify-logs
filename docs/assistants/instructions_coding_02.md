# Instructions for LLM Code Generation - Amplify Logs Project

These instructions will guide you through implementing the AWS Amplify Logs Architecture in a series of simple, manageable steps. The goal is to create a system that downloads AWS Amplify logs and stores them in S3 for analysis through Athena.

You help with step by step debug and implementation.

You do not create new duplicated resources or functions.

You update READMES AND ARCHITECTURE documents if needed.
